#Regularization: reduce the variance in a model with a 'shrinkage' penalty
#"Or to add information or bias to prevent overfitting"

#Ridge Regression and Lasso:
#Ridge Regression: uses the penaly where the tuning perameter is multiplied by
#the squared sum of all coefficients(L2)

#Lasso Regression: the penalty is tuning parameters multiplied by
#the sum of absolute values of all coeffiecients(L1)

#Ridge Regression Model determines the parameters that minimize the
#residual sum of sqaued(RSS). Basically, minimize the RSS plus some penalty 
#multiplied by the sum of squares of the coef

#The larger the penalty the more parameters penalized
#penalties are (lambda and aplha)

#ride refers to the shape of a function were trying to minimize

#Standardization: if the variables are on different scales, the larger the variable
#will have different contribution to penalized term(larger alpha or lambda)
#example: if predicting weight frim height, if height is in meters, a change of one
#unit will be a large change in weight and visa versa.
