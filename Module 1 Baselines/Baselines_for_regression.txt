#BaseLine: a common definition of a baseline is a starting point from which to make comparisions.
#(if we fit a model to data, we need a starting point from which to make our comparisions)

#Metrics we can use for a BaseLine:
#"Rule of Thumb" - Previous knowledge or commonly known info)
#"Descriptive Statistics" - Mean, Minumim, Maximum or the variable
#"Fitting a sample model" - Linear Regression

#Weight of a penguin flipper#
#On average, for about every 20mm increase in flipper length,
#the weight of the flipper increases by about 1000g(1kg)...

#'One' penguins flipper length is 220mm, weight is 5000g(5kg).
#'Two' penguin flipper length is 190mm, weight is ???
#since we have an increase of 1000g / 20mm and the second flipper,
#is 30mm shorter the weight would be 5000g - 1500g = 3500g

#Baseline of 1000g/20mm
